  <li>Make the Sign of the Cross.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Holding the Crucifix, say the Apostles&#39; Creed.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and
        in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy
        Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
        crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day
        he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at
        the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to
        judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy
        catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
        resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

  <li><p>On the first bead, say an Our Father.</p></li>
  <li>Say one Hail Mary on each of the next three beads.</li>
  <li>Say the Glory Be</li>
  <li>
    For each of the five decades, announce the Mystery (perhaps followed by a
    brief reading from Scripture) then say the Our Father.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      While fingering each of the ten beads of the decade, next say ten Hail
      Marys while meditating on the Mystery. Then say a Glory Be. (After
      finishing each decade, some say the following prayer requested by the
      Blessed Virgin Mary at Fatima:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell; lead
        all souls to Heaven, especially those who have most need of your mercy.)
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After saying the five decades, say the Hail, Holy Queen,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope.
        To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up
        our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most
        gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our
        exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O
        loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>followed by this dialogue and prayer:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. That we may be made worthy of the
        promises of Christ. Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his
        life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of
        eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these
        mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may
        imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same
        Christ our Lord. Amen.

<h2 id="joyful-mysteries">Joyful Mysteries</h2>
<p>
  The Five Joyful Mysteries are traditionally prayed on Mondays, Saturdays, and,
  during the season of Advent, on Sundays:
</p>
<p>The Annunciation</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of
    Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the
    house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.” - Luke 1:26-27
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Visitation</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to
    a town of Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted
    Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her
    womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice
    and said, &#39;Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
    your womb.&#39;” - Luke 1:39-42
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nativity</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world
    should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was
    governor of Syria. So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town. And
    Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the
    city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and
    family of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with
    child. While they were there, the time came for her to have her child, and
    she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes
    and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.” -
    Luke 2:1-7
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Presentation in the Temple</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “When eight days were completed for his circumcision, he was named Jesus,
    the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;When the days were completed for their purification according to the
    law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just
    as it is written in the law of the Lord, &#39;Every male that opens the womb
    shall be consecrated to the Lord,&#39; and to offer the sacrifice of &#39;a
    pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,&#39; in accordance with the
    dictate in the law of the Lord.” - Luke 2:21-24
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Finding in the Temple</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, and when
    he was twelve years old, they went up according to festival custom. After
    they had completed its days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained
    behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Thinking that he was
    in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their
    relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem
    to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in
    the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions, and
    all who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers.” -
    Luke 2:41-47
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sorrowful-mysteries">Sorrowful Mysteries</h2>
<p>
  The Five Sorrowful Mysteries are traditionally prayed on Tuesdays, Fridays,
  and, during the season of Lent, on Sundays:
</p>
<p>The Agony in the Garden</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his
    disciples, &#39;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&#39; He took along
    Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress.
    Then he said to them, &#39;My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here
    and keep watch with me.&#39; He advanced a little and fell prostrate in
    prayer, saying, &#39;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from
    me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.&#39;” - Matthew 26:36-39
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scourging at the Pillar</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he had Jesus scourged, he
    handed him over to be crucified.” - Matthew 27:26
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crowning with Thorns</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and
    gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and
    threw a scarlet military cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns,
    they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling
    before him, they mocked him, saying, &#39;Hail, King of the Jews!&#39;” -
    Matthew 27:27-29
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Carrying of the Cross</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in
    from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
    They brought him to the place of Golgotha (which is translated Place of the
    Skull).” - Mark 15:21-22
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crucifixion and Death</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the
    criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. [Then Jesus said,
    &#39;Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.&#39;] They divided
    his garments by casting lots. The people stood by and watched; the rulers,
    meanwhile, sneered at him and said, &#39;He saved others, let him save
    himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.&#39; Even the soldiers
    jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine they called out, &#39;If
    you are King of the Jews, save yourself.&#39; Above him there was an
    inscription that read, &#39;This is the King of the Jews.&#39; Now one of
    the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, &#39;Are you not the
    Messiah? Save yourself and us.&#39; The other, however, rebuking him, said
    in reply, &#39;Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same
    condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we
    received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing
    criminal.&#39; Then he said, &#39;Jesus, remember me when you come into your
    kingdom.&#39; He replied to him, &#39;Amen, I say to you, today you will be
    with me in Paradise.&#39;
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until
    three in the afternoon because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of
    the temple was torn down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
    &#39;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit&#39;; and when he had said
    this he breathed his last.” - Luke 23:33-46
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="glorious-mysteries">Glorious Mysteries</h2>
<p>
  The Five Glorious Mysteries are traditionally prayed on Wednesdays and,
  outside the seasons of Advent and Lent, on Sundays:
</p>
<p>The Resurrection</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “But at daybreak on the first day of the week they took the spices they had
    prepared and went to the tomb.They found the stone rolled away from the
    tomb; but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
    While they were puzzling over this, behold, two men in dazzling garments
    appeared to them. They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground.
    They said to them, &#39;Why do you seek the living one among the dead? He is
    not here, but he has been raised.&#39;” - Luke 24:1-5
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ascension</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “So then the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven
    and took his seat at the right hand of God.” - Mark 16:19
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Descent of the Holy Spirit</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all in one place
    together. And suddenly there came from the sky a noise like a strong driving
    wind, and it filled the entire house in which they were. Then there appeared
    to them tongues as of fire, which parted and came to rest on each one of
    them. And they were all filled with the holy Spirit and began to speak in
    different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim.” - Acts 2:1-4
  </p>

<p>The Assumption</p>
<blockquote>

    great things for me, and holy is his name.” - Luke 1:48-49

<p>The Coronation of Mary</p>
<blockquote>

    moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.” - Revelation
    12:1

<p>The Baptism of Christ in the Jordan</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens
    were opened [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove
    [and] coming upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, saying, &#39;This
    is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.&#39;” - Matthew 3:16-17
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wedding Feast at Cana</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “On the third day there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and the mother of
    Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
    When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, &#39;They have no
    wine.&#39; [And] Jesus said to her, &#39;Woman, how does your concern affect
    me? My hour has not yet come.&#39; His mother said to the servers, &#39;Do
    whatever he tells you.&#39;” - John 2:1-5
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus&#39; Proclamation of the Coming of the Kingdom of God</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “&#39;This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand.
    Repent, and believe in the gospel.&#39;” - Mark 1:15
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Transfiguration</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them
    up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them; his
    face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light.” - Matthew
    17:1-2
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Institution of the Eucharist</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and
    giving it to his disciples said, &#39;Take and eat; this is my body.&#39;” -
    Matthew 26:26
  </p>
